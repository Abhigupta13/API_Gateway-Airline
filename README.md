FRONTEND  - MIDDLE-END - BACKEND

- We need an intermediate layer between the client side and the microservices
- Using this middle end, when a client sends a request we will be able to make the decision of which microservice
  should respond to this request
- We can do message validation, response transformation, rate limiting
- We try to prepare an API Gateway that acts as this middle end.
